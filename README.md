## GDPR 

### notes on intent/ forward-looking 

- ?: ordinal nature of offenses? Which breaches are considered more severe & why?
- interesting topics: nature of consent; 

### What's the scope?
  - a very broad blanket that we surely fall under-- anyone who handles data originating in the EU or produces anything destined for the EU with the data is subject to these regulations
  - "applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/)
  - Targets practices that obscure the terms a consumer consents to by using legalese/unecessarily complicated terms that no one reads. 
  - prompt notification of data breach (within 72 hrs)
  - "privacy by design" -- data protection must be built into the design of systems. This includes *data minimization*
  - Data protection officers - mandatory "for those controllers and processors whose *core activities* consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic *monitoring of data subjects on a large scale* or of *special categories of data* or data relating to criminal convictions and offences" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/)
  - internal record-keeping requirements
  
### possible consequences
- "Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/gdpr-faqs/). This is a maximum, for the most serious offences (issues with consent, etc). There is a tiered approach to offenses.

### Distinctions made/ defintions made

- Data processor versus data controller: controller = determines **purposes, conditions, and means** of processing data; processor is an entity which processes personal data *on behalf of the controller*. [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/gdpr-faqs/)


## CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

### notes on intent
- focuses heavily on consumers' rights to control the use of their data. Includes the right to: know *whether* info collected, request the specific categories of information a business collects, know *what* info collected, decline the sale of info, request deletion of personal information, **equality of service and price even when these rights are exercised**, . Implements a default to non-collection for children under 16 years old. 
### Scope
- applies to businesses that collect information in california or sell goods and services in California-- even if not located there
- in order to apply one of the following criteria must also be met: $25m+ annual revenue, possess personal data of >50,000 "consumers, households, or devices," earn more than half annual revenue selling consumers' personal data [link](https://www.dickinson-wright.com/news-alerts/californias-data-privacy-law)


### Distinctions/ definitions

- a broad, potentially overinclusive definition of "personal information" -- includes gender info/ anything "capable of being associated with" a particular consumer when combined with other datasets.

## The Swiss-uation (the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act or DPA)

- "Under Swiss data protection law, the term ‘person’ encompasses both individuals and legal entities, although this inclusion of legal entities may disappear under the revised act."
- "In general, a data subject’s consent is not required in order for data processing to be admissible. However, consent may justify data processing that would otherwise be unlawful. "
