## Miscellaneous legislation and the lines of thought revealed(passed or not)

### NYC's failed law (NYPA)-- estabishing data collectors as information fiduciaries
- would extend the already-existing concept of a fiduciary into the context of data privacy
- "information fiduciary" rules would strengthen the ability of an individual customer to sue over misuse of their data, and place more responsibility on data-using companies to 
- "fiduciaries" are generally people in professions that give them asymmetrical economic power over their customers duw to their being entrusted with sensitive information in the course of their job. Ex: doctors, lawyers, accountants... [link](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/information-fiduciaries-must-protect-your-data-privacy)
- empahsizes the trust relationship, forefronts the consumer

### Oregon's bill that would have allowed consumers to monetize their health data
- would give patients a cut of the money that organizations make from their de-identified health data
- woud require providers to get signed authorization before selling de-identified info [link](https://www.benefitspro.com/2019/02/05/oregon-bill-would-allow-consumers-to-monetize-health-data/?slreturn=20190617190230)
- an ecosystem based on the giving and selling of personal data already exists, and a bill like this would in theory loop the consumer into recieving the material value of their data. However, this also ratifies a system that would likely disadvantage those not in the position to deny a new small income stream--putting people with fewer resources at more risk of privacy loss. If privacy is a right then this is unethical. [link](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CR-letter-re-Oregon-digital-dividends.pdf)


## GDPR (and the UK's mirrored Data Protection Act)

### notes on intent/ forward-looking 

- ?: ordinal nature of offenses? Which breaches are considered more severe & why?

#### The nature of consent
- consent must be specific and unambiguous [link](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/21/google_50m_cnil_gdpr/)

### What's the scope?
  - a very broad blanket-- anyone who handles data originating in the EU or produces anything destined for the EU with the data is subject to these regulations
  - "applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/)
  - Targets practices that obscure the terms a consumer consents to by using legalese/unecessarily complicated terms that no one reads. 
  - prompt notification of data breach (within 72 hrs)
  - "privacy by design" -- data protection must be built into the design of systems. This includes *data minimization*
  - Data protection officers - mandatory "for those controllers and processors whose *core activities* consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic *monitoring of data subjects on a large scale* or of *special categories of data* or data relating to criminal convictions and offences" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/)
  - internal record-keeping requirements
  
### possible consequences
- "Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million" [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/gdpr-faqs/). This is a maximum, for the most serious offences (issues with consent, etc). There is a tiered approach to offenses. 
- businesses can only collect and process data for a well-defined purpose [link](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/data-protection-factsheet-changes_en.pdf)
- businesses cannot use algorithms to make decisions about a user based on their personal data without informing the user that this decision is automated

### Distinctions made/ defintions made

- Data processor versus data controller: controller = determines **purposes, conditions, and means** of processing data; processor is an entity which processes personal data *on behalf of the controller*. [link](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/gdpr-faqs/)
- defines various rights for data subjects: The right to access one's data, the right to be forgotten/right to erasure, the right to data portability (citizens can transfer their personal data to another service upon request)

[link](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/data-protection-factsheet-changes_en.pdf)

### Cases litigated

- most major: Google was fined $56m by the French agency CNIL for inadequately informing consumers about their data collection processes
  - "The French agency, CNIL, ruled [...] that the search giant had offered users inadequate information, spreading it across multiple pages, and had failed to gain valid consent for ads personalisation." [link](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/21/google_50m_cnil_gdpr/)
  - Google failed to obtain adequate consent from users-- consent must be unambiguous and specific
  - Mathias Moulin, CNIL's director of the rights protection and sanctions directorate, said that the fine was based on five factors, including "the type of violation, its scale – it was continuous, rather than a one-off, and affected lots of people and massive amounts of data – and the size of the company."
  
- Twitter denies Subject Access Request on grounds of "disproportionate effort," 


## CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

### notes on intent
- focuses heavily on consumers' rights to control the use of their data. Includes the right to: know *whether* info collected, request the specific categories of information a business collects, know *what* info collected, decline the sale of info, request deletion of personal information, **equality of service and price even when these rights are exercised**, . Implements a default to non-collection for children under 16 years old. 
- ensures that consumers have the ability to opt out--requires that there be a clear and visible button that says "do not sell my personal information"
- heavy focus on transparency obligations 

### Scope
- applies to businesses that collect information in california or sell goods and services in California-- even if not located there
- in order to apply one of the following criteria must also be met: $25m+ annual revenue, possess personal data of >50,000 "consumers, households, or devices," earn more than half annual revenue selling consumers' personal data [link](https://www.dickinson-wright.com/news-alerts/californias-data-privacy-law)
- "The law notably establishes a broad definition of “personal information,” drawing in categories of data including a consumer’s personal identifiers, geolocation, biometric data, internet browsing history, psychometric data, and inferences a company might make about the consumer." [link](https://hbr.org/2018/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new-data-privacy-law)
- includes as "personal data" any data that can be linked to a device or household

### Distinctions/ definitions

- a broad, potentially overinclusive definition of "personal information" -- includes gender info/ anything "capable of being associated with" a particular consumer when combined with other datasets. [link](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/will-ccpa-be-a-dumpster-fire-for-those-79549/### consequences)

## The Swiss-uation (the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act or DPA)

- "Under Swiss data protection law, the term ‘person’ encompasses both individuals and legal entities, although this inclusion of legal entities may disappear under the revised act."
- "In general, a data subject’s consent is not required in order for data processing to be admissible. However, consent may justify data processing that would otherwise be unlawful. "
